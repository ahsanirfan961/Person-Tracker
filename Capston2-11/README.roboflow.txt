The dataset includes 11484 images.
Person are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image:
* Randomly crop between 0 and 20 percent of the image
* Random shear of between -10° to +10° horizontally and -10° to +10° vertically
